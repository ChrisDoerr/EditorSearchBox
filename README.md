# Editor Search Box

Editor Search Box is a free plugin for WordPress. It adds a simple search box in the sidebar to the post/page editor so you don't have to go back to the index page first.

With this plugin you will search the same post types as the one you currently have loaded in the editor.

The search requires a) that Javascript is enabled and b) that you click the search button. Hitting the RETURN key will save to post.

Which brings us to the usual warning:

When you perform a search you will be directed to the search results page without saving the changes you just might have done to the currently opened post or page!
